# PUSH FILES INTO YOUR RESPECTIVE NAME DIRECTORIES

# DON'T WORRY ABOUT PUSHING SOMETHING THAT SHOULD NOT BE PUSHED (such as .env files). I HAVE ADDED A .gitignore files that will automatically ignore these when you push the files.

# ALSO DON'T DELETE THE .gitkeep FILES. OTHERWISE, GITHUB CANNOT TRACK EMPTY DIRECTORIES. IF YOU HAVE ANY EMPTY DIRECTORY IN YOUR CODE, PLEASE PUT THE .gitkeep FILE THERE.
